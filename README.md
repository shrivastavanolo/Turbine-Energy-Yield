# Turbine-Energy-Yield
Analyzing Turbine energy yield of a power plant using Machine Learning

In this project we will focus on how Gas turbine CO and NOx Emission
impacts the energy yield of a Turbine using various machine learning models. We will
use ambient features such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge
pressure along with CO and NOx emission.
